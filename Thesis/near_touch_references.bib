Since our prototype utilizes an LCD, we discuss and compare the advantages that HD LCD monitors provide over projectors. Secondly, we give an overview of the sensing data the system can detect, and what interaction techniques it enables. Since our approach is scalable, we anticipate being able to implement multi-touch and tangible interactions on large high-definition LCD monitors in the future.}},

Touch detection by frustrated total internal reflection is useful for achieving interaction with tabletop displays, but the technique is not always reliable when multiple users in close proximity simultaneously interact with the display. To solve this problem, we combine touch detection and hand tracking techniques in order to allow multiple users to simultaneously interact with the display without interference. Our hope is that by considering activities occurring on and above a tabletop display, multiuser interaction will become more natural and useful, which should ultimately support collaborative work.}},
