\section{Future Work}
The best models presented as Algorithms 1 and 2 can be used to design applications with near touch and bimanual interaction capabilities, which can be evaluated for usability in future studies.

In order to apply our results to a more general context in which the user can move around the display, one could study a user's position with respect to the interaction surface.
One approach that has been used for localizing presence of users near an interactive surface is proximity sensing \cite{Annett:2011:MPAMT}.
Our study used a static angle of $60\degree$ and a fixed size display for the interface. 
Further research could measure the effects of changing the angle and size of the display for our presented models. In addition, future research should examine the effect of a crowded scene on gesture interactions, since this could change the way in which users grab and release objects.

Because grab and release actions did not produce a large difference in the proposed models, we excluded action type from our model for the center of action.
For other action types that involve different patterns in the trajectory of features, action type may need to be considered as a factor.
Therefore, future research could extend our model to cover other near touch actions besides grab and release.  
One could parameterize and detect other near touch actions such as flick, scoop, shake, throw, turn, twist, etc.
We intend to focus our future research on these types of actions as opposed to symbolic gestures, because of their intuitiveness and cross cultural meanings.

%Aras: I am not sure how/if to include this:
%while the result apply to majority of population, there are minority groups of people who are differently abled with respect to hands
%this limitation is that this study does not apply much to people who for example are missing a hand or some of their fingers.
%further study is needed to find alternative forms of interaction to allow designers to create more accessible interfaces

\section{Conclusions}
We have presented empirical findings for parameterizing grab and release actions using a customized near touch technology. 
We used these findings to define a method for locating the center of grab and release actions as well as an approach for distinguishing which hand was used for the interaction.
These empirical model data and near touch tracking system contributions provide new opportunities for natural and intuitive hand interactions with computing surfaces.
